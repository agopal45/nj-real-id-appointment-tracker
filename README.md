# NJ REAL ID Appointment Tracker
A tool built using webscraping scripts in Python to track appointment availability for upgrading NJ State ID to REAL ID.

Starting in May 2025, REAL ID became the only valid Driver License identification for domestic travel in the United States. As a result of this change, the process to schedule an appointment has been extremely backlogged making it difficult to schedule an appointment with NJ MVC so this script uses webscraping to monitor the availability of appointments and send an email notification.
